// Implementing character moves by controller. 
// W,S,A,D, and Spacebar used to move and jump character.
// Added IA_PlayerController, IA_Jump, IMC_PlayerController

*8/18/2024
// Add Bullet Component.
// Bullet has collision component, bodyMesh Comp, and Projectile movement Component which is provided by Unreal Engine.
// BodyMesh of Bullet is set to a basic Sphere shape for now. 


* 8/19/2024
// Add Weapon Component.
// Declare the Weapon Component in "Player. " C++ source.
// Mesh of the Weapon is using basic GunMesh from Unreal Engine 5 for now. (GunMesh will be changed after getting new Mesh.)

// Add a inputAction to fire the Bullet from the Weapon. The input Key is "Left Mouse Button"
// The bullet is generated it in front of the Weapon and "SpawnActor" function  is used to realize in the game. 
// Each Bullet is destroyed in 2 sec. 

	"Issue" 
	// The Bullet is generated too much when click the left mouse button. 
	(I guess it occurs because the bullet is generated in every frame when the left mouse button is pushed.)
	(Maybe, the bullet creator needs to be changed to recognize when a button is pressed and released as one event.)
